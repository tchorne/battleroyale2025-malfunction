Disclosure of code from previously mentioned Godot Doom tutorial:
 - Some enemy movement code (enemy.gd 100:110)
 - Enemy melee attack player (enemy.gd 182:192)
 - Camera control code (player.gd 75:78)
 - Input action switch (player.gd 112:123)
 - Raycast for enemy with duck typing (player.gd 188:191)
Any other code which is from the tutorial is either just declaring constants or is only 1-2 lines and too generic for me to distinguish originality.
